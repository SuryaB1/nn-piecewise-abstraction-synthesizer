# nn-piecewise-abstraction-synthesizer

The goal of this project is to synthesize an abstraction of a classification neural network using counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS), which is a formal method, and the Marabou neural network verification tool (neuralnetworkverification.github.io).

As of May 2024, the project is able to synthesize unrefined piecewise abstractions of binary classification neural networks with some inefficiencies and limited testing. Please see [todo.md](doc/todo.md) for next steps.
